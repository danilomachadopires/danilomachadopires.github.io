    This code presents model fitting for one (out of 12) of the discussed options from the title paper.
    Model considered is derived from Davidson (1969) proposal, adapted to address the tendency to draws
    in players of higher ratings and including a parameter for the advantage of playing white and accounting
    for the variability in players activity. 
In the paper we used Bayesian analysis of actual chess elite data to fit parametric statistical models 
    that could subsidize proposals for change in rating systems. In half of our proposals, 
    weighted likelihood density functions were used to emulate the behavior of dynamic rating systems.
Models were compared using marginal likelihood based information criteria  as well as predictive distances.
Most of our attempted models improved on Elo ratings and there is strong evidence that dynamic models
    considering both white advantage and draws would result in more accurate systems.
