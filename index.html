    This is a companion guide to the title paper. In here we present code for handling database, 
       model fitting and predictive evaluation for one (out of 6) of the discussed models. 

    In the paper we used Bayesian analysis of actual chess elite data to fit parametric statistical 
       models that could subsidize proposals for change in rating systems. In half of our proposed models,
       weighted likelihood functions were used to emulate the behavior of dynamic rating systems. 
       Models were compared using marginal likelihood based information criteria as well as predictive distances.
       Most of our attempted models improved on Elo ratings and there is strong evidence that dynamic models 
       considering both white advantage and draws would result in more accurate systems.

       Model presented in this example is derived from Davidson (1969) proposal, adapted to address the tendency
       to draws in players of higher ratings, includes a parameter for the advantage of playing white and accounts
       for the variability in players activity (dynamic version).
